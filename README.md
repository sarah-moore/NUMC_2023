This is the repository for the Math Camp for the Social Sciences at Northwestern University.

In this repository there is a page for each day of work, resources both related to and unrelated to this course, and supplementary material.

[Supplementary Material](supplementary_material/README.md)

Some of the materials here were developed based on the [Harvard Math Prefresher for Political Scientists Booklet](https://iqss.github.io/prefresher/), the [UCSD Political Science Math Camp Booklet](https://ucsdpolimathcamp.github.io/MathCamp/), as well as previous iterations of the NU Math Camp curriculum developed by Jean Clipperton.
